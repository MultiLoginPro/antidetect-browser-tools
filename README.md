Antidetection tips

Screen width/height + Window height/width – can be emulated by attaching a debugger via a Chrome extension, but screen.availHeight and screen.availWidth will still expose inconsistencies. It’s better to change screen size on a virtual machine or use an anti-detect browser.

Disable WebRTC when using proxies – mask public IP to prevent leakage: puppeteer/puppeteer#6377

Match all proper browser headers – make sure headers like accept-language, user-agent, and sec-fetch-* are in the correct order and not missing.

AudioContext fingerprint spoofing – read:

https://fb-killa.pro/threads/povyshaem-svoju-anonimnost-putem-kontrolja-nad-audiocontext-fingerprint.2759/#post-19349

Hide automation flags – make sure nothing from your scripts is visible in the global scope. Some sites collect everything via window.* and analyze it.

Avoid direct site navigation – did you know going directly to a website without a referral or Google search may be flagged using window.history.length?

Proxy leaks – always check for DNS and WebRTC leaks even if your proxy seems valid
